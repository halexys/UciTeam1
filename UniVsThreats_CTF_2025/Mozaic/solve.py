    - a way to rbp and a way to set rip
    - a place at a known address to store some strings and pointers
    - eax set to 0x3b

 Basically here we set the memory layout so that the final syscall3 call will
spawn a shell.
 This is where we choose to jump after we set eax to 0x3b,
 [rbp-4 ] needs to have a pointer to pathname
 [rbp-8 ] needs to have a pointer to envp[], we set it to null
 [rbp-16] needs to have a pointer to argv[], the convention is to have the first entry
          in argv[] be the pathname, so we need to construct a null terminated array
          with only one element, a pointer to pathname
